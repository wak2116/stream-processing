This is a basic kafka producer and consumer pair to use twitter data as a streaming source.

Realtime tweets are filtered using the "locations" parameter  
See: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/guides/basic-stream-parameters

External dependencies: 
python 3.7,
apache-zookeeper-3.5.5-bin,
kafka_2.12-2.2.0

Source code was generated in PyCharm 2019.1.2. 
Code can be run from the command line, but no effort has been taken (to date) to package it for use outside of the IDE.
